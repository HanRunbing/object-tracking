# Object-Tracking (Deep Learning & Computer Vision)
Implement a deep learning model(Yolo3) on the street video, achieving object tracking with real-time distance estimation

# Task
Given sequential rectified stereo images with camera information, the objects (including vehicles and passengers) should be detected and tracked across image frames. 

# Achievements
- The object bounding box, tracking ID, and distance from the box center to the camera optic center should be reported and shown in the video.
- Generated radar map based on the output of object tracking and distance estimation, which could clearly observe the traffic conditions on the road in real-time.
